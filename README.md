I took this course taught by Professor Asa Ben Hur from Colorado State University. All the 5 assignments are done in python and attached in this repository.

Deep Q Learning and Temporal Difference Machine Learning Algorithm to Solve Inverted Pendulum Problem

The project includes two jupyter notebooks for applying Deep Q Learning and Reinforcement Learning using Temporal Difference 
to solve inverted pendulum problem. OpenAI Gym is used to simulate Inverted Pendulum.
